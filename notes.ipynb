    "- This workflow runs when:\n",
    "- You push changes to the main branch.\n",
    "- A pull request is created for main, staging, or patch.\n",
    "- Define a Job (jobs section)\n",
    "- The workflow runs one job called test on an Ubuntu machine.\n",
    "- Step 1: Checkout the Code (checkout@v2)\n",
    "- It downloads your repository's files into the virtual machine so GitHub Actions can work with them.\n",
    "- Step 2: Set Up Python (setup-python@v2)\n",
    "- It installs Python (version 3.8 in this case) so scripts can run.\n",
    "- Step 3: Install Dependencies (pip install)\n",
    "- It updates pip (the package manager) and installs all required libraries listed in requirements.txt.\n",
    "- Step 4: Run Tests (pytest)\n",
    "- It executes the test cases using pytest, ensuring the code functions as expected.\n",
